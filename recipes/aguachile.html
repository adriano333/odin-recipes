        <h2>Ingriedients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound fresh shrimp, peeled and deviened (or other seafood of your choice)</li>
                <li>4-5 limes, freshly squeezed (apporximately 1 cup of lime juice)</li>
                <li>2-3 serrano or jalapeno chillies, finely chopped (adjust to your preferred level of spiciness)</li>
                <li>1 cucumber, sliced or diced</li>
                <li>1/2 red onion, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves, chopped</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
             </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
             <ol>
                <li>Clean and devein the shrimp, ensuring they are free from shells and veins. If using other seafood like fish or scallops, prepare the accordingly.</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the freshly squeezed lime juice and the finely chopped serrano or jalapeno chilies. Adjust the amount of chillies to suit your taste for spiciness.</li>
                <li>Place the shrimp or seafood of your choice into the lime-chilli mixture, ensuring it is fully coated. Allow the seafood to marinate for approximately 10-15 minutes. The acidity of the lime juice will "cook" the seafood, resulting in a tender and flavorful texture.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, prepare the remaing ingredients. Slice or dice the cucumber, thinly slice the red onion, and chop the cilantro leaves.</li>
                <li>After marinating, remove the shrimp or seafood from the lime-chilli mixture, reserving the liquid for later use.</li>
                <li>Arrange the marinated seafood on a serving plate, creating a single layer.</li>
                <li>Scatter the sliced cucmber, red onion, and chopped cilantro over the seafood, distributing them evenly.</li>
                <li>Season the dish with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Drizzle some of the reserved lime-chilli mixture over the seafood, ensuring it is evenly coated. Reserve the rest to serve as a dipping sauce.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately, allowing the vibrant flavors to shine</li>
             </ol>
