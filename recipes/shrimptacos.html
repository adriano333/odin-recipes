        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a bowl, combine the peeled and deveined shrimp with olive oil, minced garlic, chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper. Toss well to evenly coat the shrimp with the spices. Allow the shrimp to marinate for about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Add the marinated shrimp and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side until they turn pink and opaque. Be careful not to overcook the shrimp, as they can become rubbery.</li>
                <li>Once cooked, remove the shrimp from the heat and set them aside.</li>
                <li>Warm the tortillas by either heating them in a dry skillet for a few seconds on each side or wrapping them in a damp paper towel and microwaving them for a short burst.</li>
                <li>Assemble the tacos by placing a few pieces of shrimp onto each tortilla. Top with shredded lettuce or cabbage, diced tomatoes, chopped cilantro, and diced red onion.</li>
                <li>Squeeze fresh lime juice over the toppings for an added burst of citrusy flavor.</li>
                <li>Add any optional toppings of your choice, such as sliced avocado or guacamole, sour cream or Mexican crema, salsa or pico de gallo, and crumbled queso fresco or shredded cheese.</li>
                <li>Serve the shrimp tacos immediately, allowing everyone to customize their own toppings and squeeze additional lime juice, if desired.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>Serving Suggestions:</h2>
            <p>Accompany the shrimp tacos with a side of Mexican rice and refied beans for a complete meal. Serve with a side of tortilla chips and salsa or a refreshing salad for a lighter option. Offer a variety of hot sauces or condiments for those who enjoy an extra kick of spice. Pair with a cold Mexican beer or a refreshing fruit-infused agua fresca to complement the flavors.</p>
